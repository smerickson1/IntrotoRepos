#### The lesson materials associated with this are not specific to any particular course, and therefore can be used in a variety of classrooms such as environmental science, data science, ecology, or marine science courses. Introducing students to data repositories at the undergraduate level may open up a new world of research and learning opportunities for them now or as future scientists.

**Course Format**: 

This module is meant to be taught within the timeframe of one lab period (or approximately 2 hours in length). Included in this lesson is an introductory video and prepared PowerPoint with time allotted for exploration into the Arctic Data Center’s repository and completion of an in-class assignment. Instructors may want to assign students additional out of classwork, or use additional modules to round out a full unit.
