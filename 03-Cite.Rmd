Data citation is the practice of referencing data products used in research. A data citation includes key descriptive information about the data, such as the title, source, and responsible parties. As we touched upon the previous lesson on metadata, data authors serve an important role in storing data. They also create data citations. These citations are used when data is referenced in a scientific study, education, or other activities. While it may seem like data citation is part of the “preserve” phase, it is actually part of the describe phase.Even though it is standard practice to cite scientific articles, it is not yet common practice to cite data. Both long and short term goals are helping change the narrative around research by encouraging adoption of practices that are in line with open science. 

Much like metadata, there are numerous, optional components to a potential citation. Further, also like the metadata record, the more information you can provide, the more replicable and complete you can be. Accessing the data citation is done through a persistent identifier. This is where you can find the metadata.

**Ask students** to download the dataset files from the dataset they were using in the metadata lesson. Have the students open up the files and familiarize themselves with the file types associated with this dataset. Using the dataset they downloaded, assign [this assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ei9YN7lofG-BJPDZKYJ9fc_oSsARTYIQ_V42xleP2s/edit?usp=sharing) for the students to complete in their own time.

Below are the answers to the take home assignment. 

Importance: What professional norms and practices, both of individuals and of institutions or organizations, support or undermine the idea that data are legitimate and citable products of research? How? 

*Possible answers include promotion and tenure criteria at universities (data may or may not be valued as scholarly contributions), research funders policies (they may encourage demonstrating the availability of data sets created with prior funding, data in CVs, and require sharing data), publishers may encourage or require data sharing and citation, data centers may provide recommended citations for data sets.*

Credit and attribution: Credit and attribution of more traditional types of research products is an established norm and practice; is extending this practice to include data a simple and natural thing to do? Why or why not? 

*On the surface, yes, but questions of what constitutes an authorship role may be an issue (see Duke and Porter paper), note also some of the possible responses to question 1.*

Evidence: Citing literature to support claims is also an established practice; is extending this practice to include data a simple and natural thing to do? Why or why not? 

*Not all data are in a data center or repository and formally citable; authors may not be familiar with data citation practices.* 

Unique identification: Is it always possible for a data creator to obtain a persistent identifier for their data set? Why or why not?

*The repository or data center may or may not supply a persistent identifier, data creator may or may not have access to an identifier service to create one themselves; identifiers must be maintained in order to continue to work.* 

Access: In practice, do data citations always provide direct access to the data set? Why or why not? 

*Sometimes - data centers only provide metadata and contact information and data must be obtained from the data creator or another party.*
